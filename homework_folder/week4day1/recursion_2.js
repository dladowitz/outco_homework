  *                          Homework VIII                                *
  *                                                                       *
  *  Problem: Lattice Paths                                               *
  *                                                                       *
  *  Prompt: Count the number of unique paths to travel from the top left *
  *          to the bottom right of a lattice of squares.                 *
  *                                                                       *
  *  Input:  An interger N (which is the size of the lattice)             *
  *  Output: An interger (which represents the number of unique paths)    *
  *                                                                       *
  *  Example: N = 2 (2x2 board) => 6 (number of unique paths)             *
  *                                                                       *
  *  What is the time and auxilliary space complexity of your solution?   *
  *                                                                       *
  *  Note: When moving through the lattice, you can only move either down *
  *        or to the left.                                                *
  *                                                                       *
  *        Try implementing your solution using side effects recursion or *
  *        pure recursion.                                                *
  *                                                                       *
