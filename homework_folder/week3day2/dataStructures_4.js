  *          addVertex: Method that accepts an id (int/str), and creates an object *
  *                     with a "value" of id, and a property called "edges" which  *
  *                     will store the edges of the vertex. If a vertex with the id*
  *                     already exists, then do not create a new vertex.           *

  *          getVertex: Method that takes an id, and outputs the vertex with the   *
  *                     matching id, if it exists.                                 *

  *          removeVertex: Method that takes an id as its input, and removes the   *
  *                        vertex with the matching id.                            *

  *          addEdge: Method that accepts two different id's as its input, and     *
  *                   creates an edge between both vertices.                       *
  *                   (This edge may look like [id1,id2])                          *

  *          removeEdge: Method that accepts two different id's as its input, and  *
  *                      removes the edge between the two vertices if it exists.   *
  *                                                                                *
  *          findNeighbors: Method that accepts an id as its input, and returns    *
  *                         all of the edges of that vertex.                       *
  *                                                                                *
  *          forEachNode: Method that accepts an operation, and performs that      *
  *                       operation on each vertex in the Graph.                   *
  *                                                                                *
  *  Input:  N/A                                                                   *
  *  Output: A Graph instance                                                      *

  *  What are the time and auxilliary space complexities of the various methods?   *
